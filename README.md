This is a non-commercial fangame made for fun that puts the characters of EarthBound in a comedic text-adventure game styled after famous LucasArts titles like Maniac Mansion, Day of the Tentacle, and the Monkey Island series.

The game was created for an EarthBound fan-forum contest and won first place.
